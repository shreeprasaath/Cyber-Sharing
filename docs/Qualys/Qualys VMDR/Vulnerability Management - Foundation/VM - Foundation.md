# Introduction

Vulnerability Management (VM) means systematically and continuously finding and eliminating vulnerabilities in your computer systems. Many of the steps or processes involved in VM use technology; other steps need IT staff to implement patches, software updates, and follow-ups. The integration of these processes produces more robust computer security and protects the organization's systems and data.

## Scoping Systems to Identify Inventory aka Asset Discovery

To find vulnerabilities, you must first understand what assets (such as servers, desktops, copiers, and mobile devices) are running on your network, which involves uncovering forgotten devices. You cannot secure what you do not know. You also need to identify the people who are responsible for maintaining these assets (the owners).

The primary purpose of scoping, also called asset discovery, is to organize your computer systems according to their role in your business to establish an evaluation baseline. Scoping starts with a vulnerability scan – usually done by directing the scanner at a particular Internet Protocol address or range of addresses, so it's helpful to organize your database by IPs.

Internet-facing assets are at high risk for attacks. Always begin asset scoping with internet-facing assets. Scoping starts with a vulnerability scan—usually done by directing the scanner at a particular IP address or range of addresses, so it's helpful to organize your database by IPs; this is one way. In addition to an active vulnerability scanner, various sensor types used for asset discovery and vulnerability detection may be needed, depending on your environment.

## Assessing the Security Posture of the IT infrastructure

Assessments are done through vulnerability scanning, which is the fundamental process for identifying and remediating vulnerabilities on your computer systems. You can assess this in two ways:

1. A one-off scan gives you a snapshot of the security status of your computer systems at a particular moment in time.
2. A recurring scheduled scan using a vulnerability scanner or agent allows you to track the speed of applying patches and software updates and assess how your security status improves. This level of assessment provides you with more information that is useful for an effective VM.

In both cases, making a scan involves two steps:

1. The scanner uses its library of vulnerabilities to test and analyze computer systems, services, and applications for known security holes.

2. A post-scan report organizes and prioritizes the actual vulnerabilities and gives you information for applying patches and updates.
